### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I'm Chinedu and resident in British Columbia, Canada. I do fullstack development and mobile application development. I'm also very interested in product design and software architecture. I enjoy using frontend technologies and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Angular JS. I'm also passionate about backend technologies such ash django framework, and the entire lifecyle of software design and architecting. I'm constantly in search of opportunities to contribut to the success of any technology-driven organization, whilst learning new technologies and business skills.
